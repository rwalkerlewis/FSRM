# SCEC TPV103: Inelastic Benchmark - Rate-State Friction with Plasticity
# =============================================================================
# Reference: https://strike.scec.org/cvws/tpv103docs.html
#
# Combines rate-state friction on the fault with off-fault plasticity.
# Tests interaction between friction and bulk inelasticity.
