# SCEC TPV17: Subshear to Supershear Transition
# =============================================================================
# Reference: https://strike.scec.org/cvws/tpv17docs.html
#
# Tests the transition from subshear to supershear rupture propagation.
# High initial shear stress relative to normal stress promotes supershear.
