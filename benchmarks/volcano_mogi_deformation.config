# Volcano Benchmark: Mogi Deformation Source
# =============================================================================
#
# Benchmark for verifying volcanic deformation calculations against the
# analytical Mogi (1958) point source solution.
#
# Test case: Spherical pressure source at 5 km depth with 10 MPa overpressure
#
# Verification metrics:
#   - Radial displacement within 1% of analytical solution
#   - Vertical displacement within 1% of analytical solution
#   - Tilt within 2% of analytical solution
#   - Correct distance decay (1/r² for far-field)

#   and the deformation of the ground surfaces around them. Bull. Earthq.
